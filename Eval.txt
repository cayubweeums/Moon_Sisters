The intent was to create a game in which two sisters are going through different worlds. Their only goal is to reach the end of the world. The sisters are able to join with each other, 
and can throw one another. Being able to throw one another is almost essential to traversing the terrain. Each world seems to have a theme, but there are odd platforms leading the sisters
to the end of their current world. 

Mechanics:
    Arrow key - left and right
    Space - jump
    E - Pickup/Throw sister
    Left-Click(mouse) - switch sisters

    IF you read this before the game, you must situate the sisters in such a way so that you can quickly switch between them and use one of them to grab onto the other.

    While writing this game I enjoyed being able to divided the work up. It made it alot more managable for me. This was also a struggle, becuase it was difficult to get everything working at
    the same time for everyone. This wasnt too bad, we just had to do a lot of fixing. I also enjoyed seing how the different parts from different people came together. It was cool to see different 
    components finally come together to look like a playable game.  One struggle was trying to create levels for a game that i didnt have a full understanding of the game mechanics for, but 
    it worked out okay in the end.
